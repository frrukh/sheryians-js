// DIFFERENCE BETWEEN var let AND const.

// var and let are used to declare variables.
// const is used to declare constant.(A variable that cannot be reassigned.)

// DIFFERENCE NO 1-(es5:var, es6:let, const)
    // there are 2 versions of js. ES5 and ES6.
    // var is from ES5.
    // let and const are from ES5.


// DIFFERENCE NO 2-(var is function scoped, let and const are braces scoped.)
    // SCOPE:
        // var is function scoped. i.e it can be used anywhere in its parent function.
        // var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.
function abc(){
    for(var i=0; i<12; i++){
        console.log(i)
    }
    console.log(i) // 12 , not error, declared with var which is function scoped.
}

abc()

        // let is braces scoped. i.e it can be used just inside its braces.

function abcd(){
    for(let i=0; i<12; i++){
        console.log(i)
    }
    // console.log(i) // ReferenceError: i is not defined , declared with let not with var.
}

// abcd();

    // const is same like let.
function abcde(){
    for(let i=0; i<12; i++){
        console.log(i)
    }
    // console.log(i) // Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined at abcde , declared with const not with var.
}

abcde();

// DIFFERENCE NO 3 -(var add itself to the window object , var and const do't add)

// ********************
// Q: What is window object?
// A: somethings that are not the part of js (they are the part of browser) but we can use them in js are stored in a object called window object.
// Q: can we see the window object?
// A: yes, just go to the console window and type 'window' and hit enter.
// ********************

    // var adds itself to the window object.(that causes to leak you variables data.)
var a = 12; 

    // let and const do't add themselves to the window object.
let b = 13;
const aa = 14;
