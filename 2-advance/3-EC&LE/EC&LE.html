// EXECUTION CONTEXT.
// execution context is a container in which the function's code is executed.it's always created when the function is called.it contains three things,variables,functions, lexical environment environment of that function.

// it is an environment that created when a function runs.
// it contains three things:
    // 1- variables that are declared in that function.
    // 2- functions that are declared in that function.
    // 3- lexical environment

// LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT.
// it is a chart that holds the values that the function can access and the values that the function can't access. i.e. it holds its scope and scope chain.
