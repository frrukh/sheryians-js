// CALL BACK FUNCTIONS
// it is a part of asynchronous javascript.
// in async js the call back function is a reminder for the js interpreter to run the code that was in pending.

setTimeout(function run(){
    console.log('3 second baad chala!')
}, 3000)
    // in this example the code inside the function is in pending for 3s. after 3s the call back function was called automatically to remind the interpreter to run the code that was in pending and this type of functions are called CALL BACK FUNCTIONS.
